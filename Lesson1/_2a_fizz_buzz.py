"""
FizzBuzz is a classic programming challenge.

For every number from 1 to n,
print Fizz if the number is divisible by 3,
print Buzz if the number is divisible by 5,
print FizzBuzz if the number is divisible by 3 and 5,
otherwise, print the original number otherwise

# Todo: Write a function that returns:
#  "Fizz" if the number is divisible by 3
#  "Buzz" if the number is divisible by 5
#  "FizzBuzz" if the number is divisible by 3 and 5
#  the number otherwise


# Todo: Test the function


# Todo: Request a number from the user


# Todo: Print a list of fizz-buzzed numbers from 1 to the given number
